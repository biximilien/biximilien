### Hi, I'm Bix

Backend-focused Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, data pipelines, and cloud-native platforms.

I enjoy working on personal projects to explore new technologies and deepen my understanding of distributed systems, AI-driven workflows, and backend architecture. Most of my experiments and prototypes live here on GitHub.

#### Core interests:

- Backend engineering (Ruby, Python, Go, TypeScript)
- Distributed systems & event-driven architectures
- Data pipelines and reliability engineering
- Productionizing LLM-based systems (Ollama, LangChain, retrieval workflows)

If you’re working on interesting backend or data problems, I’m always open to thoughtful technical conversations.
