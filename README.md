### Hi friends and welcome to my Github profile

I'm a professional software developer, currently working as a senior software developer at [Auxa Health](https://auxahealth.com).

As an enthusiast, I love to spend time on my own software projects. This is typically how I stay on top of all the shiny new technologies. You can find most of my experiments in my git repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript with frameworks such Next.js & React, and experimenting with Bun and Deno
- ðŸ’¬ I have a lot of experience with Ruby and Rails, feel free to ask me anything about Ruby
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me using my either my e-mail address or LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be an entrepreneur. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
